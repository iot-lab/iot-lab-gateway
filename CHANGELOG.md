Changelog
=========


Version 0.3
-----------

 * Support M3/A8 architecture
 * Experiment start/stop
 * Serial port redirection
 * Node flash/update
 * Control Node monitoring
 * Monitoring profile update

### Control Node features ###

 * Power management
 * Power consumption monitoring
 * Radio rssi monitoring
 * Radio sniffer with ZEP encapsulation


Version 0.4.0b
--------------

 * Node debugger
 * Adapt update_profile to experiment handler new request

 * Cleanup setup.py and use tox for managing tests

- 0.4.1b: Fix setup.py
- 0.4.2b: Fix static files not released at install
+ 0.4.3b: Replace log debug by log info on gateway_manager commands


Version 1.0.0
-------------

 + Reorganize code so `gateway_manager` depends on `nodes` which then depends
   on `utils`
 * Clean tests for new classes.
 * Allow select tests with nose attribute
 * Move 'cli' implementations in a 'utils' submodule


Version 2.0.0
-------------

 + Reorganize all 'nodes' implementation to makes adding new archis easier.
   Architectures specific code is now in `open_nodes` with one module per node.
   (Romain Jayles)
 + Use a `serial_redirection` for a8 nodes boot debug.
 + Disable Battery charge on control node. Batteries are now removed.

### Add new architectures support ###

 + HiKoB Fox
 + Arduino Leonardo

### Tests ###

 + Use WebTest for rest server, this tests that the correct REST method is used
 + Improve `integration_fabfile.py` to run on all hosts by default and run all in
   one command.
 + Run c tests from 'tox'

+ Version 2.0.1: Fix Pylint 1.5 messages


Version 2.1.0
-------------

### Bug fixing ###

* Add a timeout for flashing/reset nodes.
* Do terminate or kill for `cn_serial_interface` as it sometimes does not stop.

### Features ###

* Upgrade to oml2.11 and rebuild oml header at each compilation.
* Put openocd 'target/stm32f1x.cfg' as an option as it not required for all
  nodes. Wont be needed for samr21x-pro nodes.

### Tests ###

* Use texstfixtures.LogCapture for testing logs instead of mock.
* Fix integration tests with openocd-0.9
* Don't crash autotest on no return from 'echo'

+ 2.1.1: Fix: `node_leonardo` wait tty ready, add some delay.


Version 2.2.0
-------------

### Features ###

+ Verify firmware elf target before using them.
  Invalid firmware may be uploaded, mainly with custom nodes so fail early.
+ Reject concurrent requests on `gateway_manager` instead of waiting for
  termination. Ensures only one REST request is processed at a time.
  Prevent the server to be blocked and crash on many requests if one is stuck
  infinitely.
+ verify open nodes classes implementation for given AUTOTESTS in firmware.

### Bug fixing ###

- Ensure `serial_redirection` gets stopped. It rarely does not close on
  SIGTERM. So try several sigterms/sigint and then sigkill.
- Wait a bit before using leonardo tty when visible, as may not be ready.

### Tests ###

+ Release udev rules before running integration tests. Will allow running tests
  with new nodes implementation.
+ Catch all REST methods exceptions and display a stacktrace, will help debug
  errors instead of only showing the 500 error.
+ Fix permissions just before running integration tests to make it work when
  doing `release python_test`.
+ Add `post_install` and `udev_rules_install` setup.py and fabric commands.


Version 2.3.0
-------------

### Features ###

+ Add samr21-xpro board support
+ Autotests:
    - Verify that all open nodes features have been tested, should help detect
      missing tests in autotests.
    - Add a test that verifies only `leds_on` and `leds_off`.

Version 2.4.0
-------------

+ Update control node firmware to new version:
    - More reliable serial, allows faster monitoring measures
    - Fix 120ppm constant drift
+ Fix samr21 flash timeout
+ Add a logger for cli scripts, helps debugging on boards

Version 2.4.1
-------------

+ Increase flash timeout to 100s
+ Fix pylint 1.7 issues
